\section*{Question 1: Shortest Path Composition}

\noindent\textbf{Answer}\\
\begin{align*}
p^\ast &= p_1 \cdot p_2 &\text{split the $a\!\to\! b$ path at $c$ (concatenation)}\\
\text{cost}(p^\ast) &= \text{cost}(p_1) + \text{cost}(p_2) &\text{path cost additivity}\\
\exists\,\tilde p_1:\ \text{cost}(\tilde p_1) &< \text{cost}(p_1) &\text{assumption for contradiction}\\
\text{cost}(\tilde p_1\!\cdot\! p_2) &= \text{cost}(\tilde p_1) + \text{cost}(p_2) &\text{additivity}\\
&< \text{cost}(p_1) + \text{cost}(p_2) &\text{by assumption}\\
&= \text{cost}(p^\ast) &\text{from the first two lines}
\end{align*}

Since $\text{cost}(\tilde p_1\!\cdot\! p_2) < \text{cost}(p^\ast)$, 
this contradicts that $p^\ast$ is a shortest $a\!\to\! b$ path. 
Hence $p_1$ must be shortest $a\!\to\! c$. By the same argument, $p_2$ is shortest $c\!\to\! b$.


\section*{Question 2: Iterative Deepening returns shortest paths}
\begin{theorem}
On an unweighted (unit-edge) graph, Iterative Deepening DFS with limits $1,2,3,\dots$ from a source $s$ returns, for any discovered vertex $v$, a path with the minimum number of edges.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $\ell(v)$ be the shortest-path distance (in edges) from $s$ to $v$. For $d<\ell(v)$, depth-limited DFS cannot expose any $s$–$v$ path. When $d=\ell(v)$, a shortest $s$–$v$ path of length $\ell(v)$ is eligible and will be found during that pass; the procedure completes the whole $d=\ell(v)$ pass before running $d=\ell(v){+}1$. Therefore the first time $v$ is returned is at depth limit $\ell(v)$, with a shortest path.
\end{proof}

\section*{Question 3: Diameter bound}

\begin{proof}
For any $u\neq v$, any simple $u$–$v$ path visits vertices at most once, 
hence uses at most $|V|-1$ edges.
 A shortest $u$–$v$ path is simple (otherwise remove a cycle to shorten it). 
 So $\dist(u,v)\le |V|-1$ for all pairs, and the maximum over pairs is at most $|V|-1$.
 The diameter is at most $|V|-1$.
\end{proof}

\section*{Question 4 — Dijkstra’s Algorithm and Shortest Paths}

\begin{theorem}
Let $G=(V,E,w)$ be a directed graph with strictly positive edge weights $w(e)>0$. When Dijkstra’s algorithm is run from a source $s$ and it returns a path to any vertex $v$, the returned path has length $\delta(s,v)$, the true shortest-path distance from $s$ to $v$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Assume for contradiction that some vertex is \emph{settled} with an incorrect label. 
Let $v$ be the first such vertex extracted from the priority queue with $d[v]>\delta(s,v)$;
 thus, every previously settled $u$ satisfies $d[u]=\delta(s,u)$.

Consider a shortest $s\!\to\! v$ path $P$, and let $y$ be the first vertex on $P$ that is not yet settled just before $v$ is extracted; let $x$ be the predecessor of $y$ on $P$. By choice of $y$, $x$ is settled. By the induction hypothesis for earlier settled vertices, $d[x]=\delta(s,x)$. When $x$ was settled, the relaxation of edge $(x,y)$ gave
\[
d[y]\ \le\ d[x]+w(x,y)\ =\ \delta(s,x)+w(x,y)\ =\ \delta(s,y),
\]
and since $y$ lies on a shortest $s\!\to\! v$ path, we have $\delta(s,y)\le \delta(s,v)$. Hence
\[
d[y]\ \le\ \delta(s,v).
\]
Because Dijkstra extracts the unsettled vertex with minimum key, it holds that
\[
d[v]\ \le\ d[y]\ \le\ \delta(s,v),
\]
contradicting the assumption $d[v]>\delta(s,v)$. Therefore no such $v$ exists, and every vertex is settled with its true distance; in particular, the path returned to any $v$ is a shortest path.
\end{proof}
